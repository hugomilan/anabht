ANABHT is an open-source code used to predict the optimum supplemental heat of piglets given their weight. See more details in our paper (Milan et al., 2018).

This code was written in [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/ "Octave website"), which is a programming environment similar to Matlab. This code might work on Matlab but it was not tested.

See the file example.m for an example on how to obtain predictions using our mathematical framework. Using this example code, you can obtain predictions (pointwise and standard deviations) of skin-surface temperature, skin-surface heat flux, and hair-coat surface temperature. Predictions of the optimum supplemental heat are also possible by using other functions of this code.

This GitHub repository contains the code. For the input dataset and processed data, please see our [Open Science Framework project](https://osf.io/fsqxj/ "Data for mechanistic modeling of bio-heat transfer of piglets).
