ANABHT is an open-source code used to predict the optimum supplemental heat of piglets given their weight. See more details in our paper (Milan et al., 2018).

This code was written in [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/ "Octave website"), which is a programming environment similar to Matlab. This code might work on Matlab but it was not tested.

See the file example.m for and example on how to obtain predictions using our mathematical framework. You can obtain predictions of the skin-surface temperature and heat flux and of the hair-coat surface temperature. The predictions include pointwise preditions and standard deviations.

This GitHub repository contains the code. For the input dataset and processed data, please see our [Open Science Framework project](https://osf.io/fsqxj/ "Project: Prediction of optimum supplemental heat for piglets").
